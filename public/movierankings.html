<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lord of the rings: Fellowship of the ring</h3>
<p>Amazing segway into the series of the greatest triology ever</p>
<h3>The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug</h3>
<p>The scene with Smaug and Bilbo amongst the treasure is amazing</p>
<h3>SuckerPunch</h3>
<p>Something about the dual reality of swapping between a video game/ dream like state to the real world is facinating</p>
